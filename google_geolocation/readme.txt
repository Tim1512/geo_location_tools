Go to https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/get-api-key to create a project and get an API key.

Then plug it into the key= part in the python code.


After you have an API key, you go here https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials to manage it. New policies at Google require you to sign up for payment, but there are generous, but non-specific free limits.
